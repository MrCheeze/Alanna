Okay, so it seems if you pass through the field, the gravitational pull will be true, instead of reversed.<br>
<br>
Could you head back to the hallway that was a dead-end, before 'Lin zapped the mini-pyramid?
("Mini-Mid," anyone?)
</td></tr></table>
No, this hallway was the only way in or out of this room. That makes sense about the gravity, though. Actually, I should have realized by the fact that there are open, unspilled containers of liquid in here that something was going to keep everything upright.<br>
<br>
I'll have to flip it again if I want to leave.

can you find something non-vital to toss through the ripples?

How about something from one of these pouch things? I've got four of these.<br>
Let's see, this one has...some kind of gross brown sticky paste, some fine blue powder, a dark red liquid...how about some of these light yellow pebble things?
<br><img src="Images\Alanna379.jpg"><br>
Yep, looks like reversed gravity to me. I guess that means I'm upside-down?
</td></tr>

Yes. So, we're stuck in here for now?<br>

Otherwise, through the ripples is a continuation of the hallway?

It looks the same from both sides of the ripples.<br>

Heh, this thing is actually kinda cool.
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
No, through the ripples is a dead end.<br>
<br>
>So can you flip, head to a different room, and flip it once more, and not be trapped in a room?<br>
I'm so confused... why can't you head back to the center room again? Why was that way the only exit?
</td></tr></table>
Remember how the "up" machine room had a transparent floor, and there was a room below it? This is that room. I could see the "up" machine above me. There's only one doorway on the bottom floor of this room. I could see the other three doorways in the top room from there, but I can't reach them and I can't go through the transparent floor/ceiling.

Can you go over to the bottom of the machine?

<br><img src="Images\Alanna381.jpg"><br>
Yeah, it's like the only place I can go now. The way I came in is blocked since I flipped it. I'm just gonna flip it again so we can leave, unless you guys see anything else to do. At least I know I don't have to hold on to anything when I flip it now.

Oh come on guys. We can do this.<br>
<br>
Flip, go to the "Up" machine room, and flip again. The dead-end should become a hallway... I think.

I guess it's okay to stand in the hallway, as long as I'm not on the other side of the ripples.

Once you get up there, back to that next intersection, flip the pyramid again. Let's see where this ramp goes when we're inverted.

If we're seeing where the ramp goes, wouldn't it be more convenient to just flip it from this side?<br>

I'm getting tired of running up and down these hallways, guys.<br>

"Again, Lin."

See if you can go out the opening while it switches and get an idea of how this thing works, guys.

Couple problems with that. One, the blue crystal I had is in the wall now. Two, I only have one red.<br>
<br>
I don't think this thing runs on crystals, anyway. They are way too small for these pipes, they're just totally loose in there. This thing seems to be some sort of liquid dispenser, judging by the three vats of this colored goop over there. The red and the blue containers are almost empty, but the green one is pretty full.<br>
<br>
I get that these pipes fit in these cylinders with the dials at the top. Each cylinder seems to have an opening on the front, back, left, and right. There's a broken pipe spewing blue liquid in the back left, and a place where this pipe probably fell out spewing red liquid on the front right.

I don't think I need to freeze it, it screws in place pretty well. It probably just got knocked out by that collapsed big guy.<br>
