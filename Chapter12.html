I can see more clearly with it on than I could with it off.<br>

Alanna. No.<br>

Tristan killed your parents, it's true. But you killed him. Tristan is dead.<br>

Let this Tristan live. Enough life has ended, enough pain has been brought down here. Don't let one more innocent die, when so many have fallen for such petty reasons.<br>

No, Alanna, give him the trenchcoat or something not a beating to his face, for he has been removed of all his evil and anything else by OB, so pretty much he's like an empty rock that can move and is made of flesh.

Alanna, If you kill this 'Tristan', who is no longer Tristan, having no memories, then you are no better than he was!

Alanna no, you've done enough. Its over now. Tristan is gone. Its time to go home now. Everything Tristan was is gone. His body and now his mind.

Is it really worth it? He has lost everything. Everything. He has no memories of birthdays gone by, no beloved toys, no family, no friends. He has nothing.<br>

He essentially just got mind raped.

There would be no point in killing him now. He is no longer Tristan. OB has done far more to him than you ever could have.<br>

Grab him and run/drag him back into the complex.<br>

You should probably go and get some fruit for ourselves, maybe some for him as well as you are probably both hungry.<br>

You should probably dress him up in the trench coat for at least two reasons.<br>
1. I don't think taking him to Tristan's room is a good idea.<br>
2. Continence is probably something he no longer possesses.<br>
<br>
Maybe hug him?<br>
I don't know if you would want to, I would probably be fluctuating between hating him for everything he was and what he did and pitying him for everything that was taken from him.

Unless I misread the situation earlier with Tristan, it seemed like OB left him of its own accord. Could EB do the same? He's been suspiciously quiet during this whole thing.<br>

Is there a reason you're sticking around, EB?

What exactly are the qualifications for getting to use fire magic? Other than not having the ice deity bound to things bound to you? Maybe someone should ask him?

<font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #0000FF">I understand little of what's going on, here. I understand you are attempting to remove me from her body? My presence would likely make any of her kind use ice magic, but I do not know what kind she would use if I were not here.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I am still here. OB left because Tristan asked him to, saying something along the lines of "get out of my head", and OB agreed. It takes an agreement by both parties, in the case of an amalgamation with a sentient being.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what I'm stuck to qualifies as sentient, or is capable of entering an agreement if it is. From what little I understand in my position in this, there seems to be a spectral entity in the shape of Alanna, which either has no consciousness or one that is disconnected from the body itself. I'm guessing it acts as some sort of conduit or mediator between her mind and the minds of the advisors. Does that make sense? Are you aware of anything like that? I do not know how you view or interact with our world.</span></font>
