I've got three red crystals and two of every other color. I found the third red one in Tristan's chest.<br>
I have those four spell component pouch things, but I still don't know how to use them and they'll just weigh me down, so I don't think I'll take them. I've got some fruit, which might be good to carry, since EB seems to draw power from what I eat. I've also got a change of clothes I looted from Tristan's wardrobe. It's normal everyday clothing: t-shirt, some shorts with lots of pockets, and some boots. I've also got some soap I used to wash up with, but I doubt that will be useful either.

I burned the other gear, too. No one deserves to have their death put up on display like some kind of trophy. It's dangerous to wear enchanted gear when you don't know what it does, anyway.<br>

I feel good. My mind is clear. I know what I need to do. How do you feel? What else did you think I should burn?
