This SCREAMS final battle. You sure you're prepared?

Man, don't say that, please.

How sturdy are those things?

Head on in. Don't look down, or try to think what happens if you fall into an infinite void.

Why did you have to say that? You might as well tell someone to stop thinking about breathing.
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
First, get determined.
</td></tr></table>
With all that happened to me today, the fact that I'm out trying to explore this shit doesn't show determination enough for you?
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
There's still more to explore, don't go in just yet.
</td></tr></table>
Okay, that's true. Where would you suggest I explore before here? There's the door at the end of the circle symbol hallway (which should lead somewhere out where I am now anyway, if this place works the same way as the other one...), the door "Tristan" said he's waiting behind, and that doorway in his room. I just figured here's as good a place to start as any, since I don't think I can open those other doors, and who knows what kind of stuff that guy keeps around his bedroom?

Yeah. I got this.
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
No matter what else happens, we need to make sure to get you through that fire door before you go to confront Tristan. These are the primal forces of nature here, and without the help of AB I feel like things could go really badly. For all life.

I'd need something to make fire magic. A fire sprite, some kind of enchanted fire weapon, something. I don't know how to summon anything...

Actually, start here. It doesn't look too dangerous.

It feels empty. It's very quiet.

Have him shoot lightning at the tip.

I'd see if that tip is a means of communicating with OB... Tell Franklin to zap it?

"Franklin, zap the yellow thing!"

Didn't seem to do m-WOAH! I'm dropping!

Well, crap, Franklin's still up there!<br>
<br>
What do I do now?<br>
<br>
Hang on a second...
<br><img src="Images\Alanna305.jpg"><br>
It's doing it again, backwards!

Aww.

But then he will not be able to shut/open it back out again should anything happen.
I'd ask Franklin if he could do it and wait for you to yell to change it back before he did.
</td></tr></table>
<br><img src="Images\Alanna308.jpg"><br>
I don't think he'd be able to hear me all the way up there, through all this stuff, if he even winds up outside when this thing flips around. What is this made of anyway, copper or something?<br>
<br>
So if I'm understanding this thing right, when it's up like it is now, I can either go through the yellow door I came in, or I could stand on the platform, flip it, and wind up inside the top pyramid.<br>
<br>
If we flip it down like it was a second ago, we'd either be able to go to whatever door that is down there, or we'd be able to jump down inside the bottom pyramid.<br>
<br>
I know that there's some way to flip it from inside the top pyramid, because Franklin did it by himself a second ago. I don't know if there's any way to do that from inside the bottom one, and I don't think Franklin could understand to wait for fifteen minutes or something, so he'd have to go with me either way.<br>
<br>
Hmm.<br>
<br>
I didn't get a good look at the bottom door on the pillar, could you guys tell me if we'd be able to open it? We need to figure out which way to go here...

Hmm, I've got... a red, two greens, and a blue.

Can't go down there then. Into the pyramid?

Okay, then.

Going exploring in a giant inverting space pyramid. Not weird at all.

Guys? Don't take this the wrong way, but...

...Worst birthday ever.

Is it actually still your birthday? You spent a lot of time incapacitated.
</td></tr></table>
I don't know. I don't have a watch. It was day outside Tristan's window, but I don't know where in the world that's located, or if it's daytime on a different day if it's in my time zone.
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Go forward (if possible.)
</td></tr></table><br>

Totally understandable Alanna. Birthdays should be happy events, not scare-the-crap-out-of-you events. Are all the tunnels completely dark, or can you make out a light source in some of them. If you can, you should take the brightest tunnel. Easier to see if anything tries sneaking up on you.
</td></tr></table>
Yeah, that's how birthdays are supposed to turn out.<br>
<br>
They're all completely dark. I guess I'm just gonna go pick one, since they all look the same.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna314.jpg"><br>
Okay, there are some lights in the ceiling, and the ones above where I'm walking are turning on, and turning off when I pass. It's totally dark behind me and in front of me.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna315.jpg"><br>
These halls look like they're designed for something much taller than a human.

Okay.<br>
The whole pyramid breaks into three around us, flips up and reassembles over us. THe bottom pyramid comes up...

There.

We go down, the top pyramid re-reassembles above us...

<br>
Wait, we can't open that door, and Franklin can't flip the pyramid anymore! We're stranded here!

The only way we can go is down that hole there. Can you guys see anything down there?
