OH! I'm really sorry, guys! I totally forgot my mom was going to do the whole "summon spectral advisors" thing while I was sleeping tonight. Man, this is embarrassing. I hope I didn't scare you off.<p>
I'm supposed to, like, think about what's going on, and you'll help me think of solutions, right? Sorry, I've never had this spell used on me before. Okay, so my name's Alanna, and I'm turning 18 today! I'm also moving out of my house for college tomorrow, but first my mom and I are gonna go to Puzzland! It's this really cool place where a bunch of people get locked in rooms with puzzles they have to figure out to get to the next room, with cash prizes when you win. That's why my mom cast this spell, she thought it'd give me...er, us, an edge, and I could get some college money.

The voice inside your head. It's your dead mother from beyond the grave that speaks to you. OOOOOoooohOOO
</td></tr></table>
Haha! Awesome. I'm glad you spectral advisors have a sense of humor. Seriously though, I can hear her downstairs.<p>
My mom's a really awesome spellcaster. She's probably the best there is at conjuring stuff, and she's not bad at other magic stuff either. She said I had a lot of magical potential, but I'd rather be an architect, and she's cool with that.

Mom taught me some basic stuff just in case something went wrong with her conjuration. I can banish other-planar things, but it takes me a few seconds. I can make some low-level protective barriers and wards. I know how to do some fire stuff, but I can barely light a candle with that if I focus really hard. I'm just supposed to go hide and set up some wards if something bad happens...

No, sorry. Even if I could, I wouldn't be able to see outside this circle. But, no one else could see in using magic, either.

This is about it. It should keep everything originating from another plane out, unless it is invited in first. That includes most spells, so it also acts as an anti-magic barrier. It's actually a bubble resting along the perimeter of the circle, going down a couple feet into the floor and up maybe seven or eight feet above it. It can still be broken by physical things from this plane, so hopefully that metal mask guy doesn't actually make it inside the house.

I don't recommend inviting 4chan. They are even more scary bastards then anything in your world.

Oh! The plane of fortune! The least aptly named of all planes. No, Don't worry, I won't. I don't plan on engaging in any illicit debauchery today.

What does hooking Franklin up to the wall outlet do?
</td></tr></table>
If I plug Franklin in, he becomes a Major Electrical Sprite for a little while rather than a Lesser one. Also, it'll knock out the power to half the city. We save that one for emergencies so we don't draw too much attention to ourselves.

How do you bathe Franklin? Does he take dust baths?

He's made of energy, so he doesn't really need to bathe.

So while you're waiting, why don't you explain what you know about magic so far. For the ones that don't know.
</td></tr></table>
Hmm. Well, it's magic, so no one really knows anything for sure. But, there's a story my mom used to read me when I was little that has something to do with it. It was translated from the Old Tongue, so some things don't make sense, but I can still remeber the gist of how it goes.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna15.jpg"><br>
In the beginning, there was a great void. The void strained against itself, ripping at its nothingness in fury. This did not sate it, and that fact made it even more furious, increasing in intensity forever, before forever. After forever passed, it ripped something out of itself. It tore at it and tore at it until the Something filled everything, and the void expired.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna16.jpg"><br>
The Something then knew that it was three: AB, the giver; OB, the knower; and EB, the consumer. AB found joy in creation, giving life, and increasing the complexity of the Weave - the world. OB wanted most to never add or remove from the Weave, to simply unravel it, study it. EB wished only to bring it into itself, and become it. Strife followed.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna17.jpg"><br>
<br><img src="Images\Alanna18.jpg"><br>
The three tore at each other, shattering themselves to pieces. The pieces became the most fundamental forces of magic: Pieces of AB became fire, giving energy where there was none. OB's pieces became lightning, separating the energies from each other and letting them crash back together of their own accord. EB's pieces became frost, robbing the heat and warmth of others. The type of element a mage can cast varies based upon which of the three they most identify with, and none can harness two energies at once. But, all the pieces fell upon the Weave, and some mingled with others and became something new. Those are the spells that do not have an elemental component.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna19.jpg"><br>
The falling pieces nearly destroyed the Weave, and the void began to reassert itself. The three saw this, and were brought to tears - AB was losing its creations, OB was losing potential knowledge, and EB was losing its sustenance. The three resolved to-
<br><img src="Images\Alanna20.jpg"><br>
OH! Uhm, something's happening!
