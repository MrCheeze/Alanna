It will have to, if I want to get back into the room I started in.

Oh! It does.<p>
So, I put the red crystal on a prong with a base of every color so far, and it worked with green and blue, but with red it shot out and shocked me. But then again, the one with the red base didn't have one of those round red crystals next to it. The one next to it was blue.<p>
The one at the end of the hall I just came from isn't in the same formation as the other three. I'm stumped there.

If you put it in the other fork, electricity would probably shoot out of the upper red ball and fry your face.

'm starting to wish it was Metalface McRedhead. BANISH IT.
</td></tr></table>
Banishing is for creatures from other planes! It doesn't work on things constructed in this plane. If we're even on the same plane anymore anyway...<p>
Other-planar entities have a distinctive look. They absorb light everywhere but their eyes, so they look black. Franklin is an other-planar entity. Those black flying hands that attacked my house were other-planar entities. You guys are other-planar entities, but you don't seem to have any physical presence that I can detect.<p>
This thing looks like it's some sort of amalgam, like those tree hands and the ones that were coming out of my lawn. They're made by summoning an other-planar entity into something from this plane. They can be summoned into living creatures, but if that happens they will continually spar for control of the body. Standard banishment doesn't work on them after they're fully incorporated, but they're also much harder to summon.

Quietly! Look at the door you just came through. Are there crystal-holders on this side? This spirit guide has an ingenious plan...

Yes, it looks identical to the one on the other side.

<tr><td bgcolor="#E2E2E2">
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Have Franklin quicky swap the crystal to this side.<p>
If you feel up to it, try to get the creatures attention. It will be risky, but if you can lure it out into the hallway, you might be able to slip past it, and then you can pull the crystal back out and lock it in the hall behind you.<p>
But this might be extremely risky, so you may want to explore other possible options first.
</td></tr></table><br>
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Okay, great! Here's my idea. First, go back to the room you woke up in, moving the crystal as necessary. This might be a little gross, but get the arm and bring it back with you to this room.<p>
Give the red crystal to Franklin, both of you staying in the room with the hand-beast. Throw the arm at the thing, and gauge if it's hostile or not. If it is, Franklin should put the crystal in the fork with the red ball on the other side, so lightning shoots out and zaps it.

I like the idea of putting the crystal in the red prong on this side (ask Franklin to do it so as not to get shocked). If I understand the crystals correctly, it'll shoot lightning at the handthing.

Using what, specifically?

Based on the comments he made when you briefly gained consciousness before that dream-thing, Metalface seems to think you're a source of great power.  He may be trying to use you to harness that power.  I think that outburst of ice magic just now was something he's trying to cultivate.

I didn't get a chance to take a good look around here before. I see some stairs and a door on each wall. The one to my left is bigger than the others and has that symbol from the red haired guy's mask on it. The one I just came from has the top part of that symbol on it, the one to my right has a circle, maybe like the middle part of the symbol, and the one straight ahead has the bottom part. They all have those weird prong setups by them.<p>
The stairs go up into the ceiling and I can't see what's up there from here.

There's a door here with a new symbol. Looks like a triangle, except one of the sides is three points.<p>
There are three prongs with spherical crystals in a row. Each one is a different color, and they all have differently-colored bases. There's an empty receptacle above it.
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Hm. Let's take a closer look at those weird prong setup things.
</td></tr></table>
Okay. We know what the one on the door I came from looks like. That door has the top of the mask symbol.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna142.jpg"><br>
The one with the circle, which was to my right when I came in, has a little wall coming out next to it, with these prongs on both sides. On the first side, there are three prongs with circular crystals in a row, one of each color. Below them is another red one. On the second side, there are three empty receptacles in a row, and they seem to line up with the three in a row on the other side. There is also an empty receptacle coming out of the wall, with a red base.<p>
The one with the bottom part of the symbol looks just like the one going to the room I started in. I know I can solve this one.<p>
The one with the full symbol doesn't have anything next to the door itself, but there is another one of those little walls coming out of the back of the staircase nearby. It's really complicated and I don't think I can describe it very well... Can you guys see it? There is already electricity flowing between the two blue ones on the left side, near the floor.<p>
Shit, these puzzles are weird. This is some weird puzzle shit.

I am maybe a little better at making ice than I was at making fire, but not by much.<p>
You don't make specific spells like that. You just harness the energies available to you. If I were powerful enough at making ice, I could make an "icicle storm" or any other type of ice formation I wanted without having to craft a specific spell for it first.

Clearly you can move on through the lower-symbol door at any time. Maybe you should take this time to come to terms with your elemental shift, while things are relatively quiet?<p>
Looking at what you said about the origins of magic, ice magic seems to be powered by the base emotions. Lust, gluttony, envy. Wrath? If you think about the masked man and what he did to your family, does it help channel your magical energies?

Hmm, the electricity keeps knocking off the ice crystals.<p>
When it's working properly, I can touch it with no problem. The electricity is pretty stable and I just have to make sure not to touch the bolt itself. It only hurts to touch it when it does whatever it was doing in the thing at the end of the first hallway. There it feels like it's just blasting out uncontrollably.<p>
I think it's a little more powerful then too, which would probably explain why touching it upgraded Franklin, but touching the other ones hasn't.<p>
And yeah, all mages' eyes turn white. It's the glow of the magic channeling through you. You don't have to be casting a spell for it to happen, you just have to be open to the flow of magical energy, see?

I don't remember, not much more than his lesser form. He's only been this way once, when he was messing with our toaster.

Yeah, it's in the same place: you could probably just run in and grab it then run out; I'd just be worried that the guy'll notice you if you try to swoop in and dash.<p>
Just be ready to defend yourself, I guess. Or run faster.

Okay. I think I can do this. I don't want to get in another fight...
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
You could try to banish whatever amalgam he's cultivating. If I'm understanding this right, you can prevent its animation if you act quickly.<p>
In any case, right now you have the element of surprise. Just grabbing the green crystal and running will forfeit that, and we have no guarantees that the figure has no spare crystals with which to open the door right away.
</td></tr></table>
I'll try to banish the thing if I can, but if things get too freaky, I'm gonna bolt. It takes me a second to harness the energy used in the banishment spell, remember? If he has a spare crystal I'll have to fight him anyway, and I don't think I have any way to make use of my element of surprise...
