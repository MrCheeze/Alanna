Hmm, I can still control it a little bit.<p>
I guess I can't stick around here forever. Someone would find me eventually. If you guys are up to it, I guess we should look for a way out.

You are worryingly unfazed by mysterious extraplanar stuff crawling all over you, and a bit too ready to trust odd gut feelings and eat mysterious fruit when in a magician's lair. But, I suppose doing nothing never gets anything done.<p>
Hmm... What do you know about extraplanar matter? Is it all alive, like Franklin and other sprites, or is there inanimate matter?
</td></tr></table>
You know, I don't think I was thinking straight when I had to deal with that. Or maybe you guys are rubbing off on me. Or maybe I can only be fazed so much in one day.

WOAH SHIT
<br><img src="Images\Alanna220.jpg"><br>
SPLASH
<br><img src="Images\Alanna221.jpg"><br>
Haha!<p>
Okay, that was kinda cool, but it didn't get me anywhere I haven't been already.<p>
I guess now we know how a waterfall can run continuously in a lake.

...Now what? How are we gonna get out? Or will we just slide down?

<br><img src="Images\Alanna222.jpg"><br>
This seems to be working okay.
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Investigate cave.<p>
Or that path GingerFace went on when you ducked underwater. I think it's behind the hill where the waterfall comes from.

That was the path towards the tree, wasn't it?
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
See if you can make some body armor out of the black stuff.
</td></tr></table>
Hmm. It's like before, the black stuff was just there, and I could move it around. Now it's more like I have to focus on keeping it there or else it disappears. I can't focus on my whole body at once.
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
This place has some weeeiiirrddd physics goin' on. Uhm... my memory of, y'know, the "real world" is kinda hazy, is this normal?<p>
If not, I'm thinking you need to find out how you got here. There must be a portal or something. Somewhere. Maybe down the path Metal Red Head Guy Who Is Evil was exploring? (I'm pretty sure he came back the other direction, so it should be clear).
</td></tr></table>
I'm guessing the portal connects the end of the tunnel going down and the inside of the cloud. There's a portal spell, but there aren't any naturally occurring portals. This place had to be set up by someone.<p>
Portal spells have a loooooong casting time, too. It takes something like a week, if I remember right.

See if you can get boobs, haha.

Alanna, your eyes turn black when you use the black-stuff-magic, you know that?

Really? I've never heard of any magic turning peoples' eyes black before.

Hmm. I'm making the black stuff come out of my hand and I don't see it.

I would be cautious about usign hte black stuff. I mean, use it if your life depends o nit, but try to avoid it, I doubt its not without consequences.

Hmm. I'll avoid it if possible.

I guess check the cave, then.

They all looked deliberately inset into the walls, I don't think I could get any out.

I'll just have to make do with what I've got, and whatever sparks Franklin can provide periodically.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna226.jpg"><br>
Okay, so following the wall with my hands, we've gone around a u-turn and descended a few feet...<p>
Oh, hang on.

Hmm. That's a little better.

Why did you have to say that?<br>

Great. Maybe I'll scare away something else in here.

No, it's still in my pocket. Now I've got two greens and a red. Where did this one come from? Did those things leave it for me?

It's another one of those door opener things.<br>

Red one on the top and the bottom. Bottom one has a green base. Three parallel connectors between them. The tops of them are, from left to right, red blue blue. The bottoms have receptacles for crystals in them.<br>

I hear them moving around, but I can't see them.<br>

I guess Franklin could make a spark again, but then he'd see where Franklin is. Franklin could absorb any electricity this guy could dish out, but he could still banish him or something. Assuming he knows how.
