Look through the coat. Is there anything in the pockets?
</td></tr></table>
<img src="Images\Alanna264-2.jpg"><br>
There's some little pouches full of stinky spell components. I don't know how to use them though.
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Yeah, I was going to say check out the yellow door... although, since you haven't seen MetalFace in some time, that's a safe assumption as to where he's going to be since he can control lightning magic.<br>
<br>
I say try out another puzzle door in the room where you found the hand/where the stairs are.
</td></tr></table>
He was coming out of that room before, but maybe he went back in.
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
So Franklin can open the lightening door, and I think the two green crystals are enough to open number 8 in the stairs room (it's hard to tell).<br>
</td></tr></table><br>
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Take the green crystal in the slot and go back to the room with the stairs.

Okay.

<tr><td bgcolor="#E2E2E2">
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
That's not a bad look for you, Alanna.<br>
<br>
Place one green crystal on the prong with the red base, and the other opposite the red sphere.

Thanks!

What is the temperature you feel, Alanna?
</td></tr></table>
A lot warmer than I was.
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Try getting some black stuff ready on your hands. You're probably gonna need it real soon.

Man, what happened to using that sparingly?

I don't think she summoned Franklin.<br>
Her mother did, I thought.
</td></tr></table>
Yep.<br>
<br>
Actually, now that I think about it, that couldn't have been one of the pale guys who was in the room I woke up in, because he didn't seem to know that Franklin came in with me. I wonder how many of those guys there are?
<br><img src="Images\Alanna268.jpg"><br>
Damnit, what now?<br>
<br>
No no, let me guess, a giant centipede made of hands.

<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
wait, we'll check it out.
</td></tr></table><br>
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Looks empty, although one of those orbs is spewing lightning and there seems to be another door in the corridor. We'll look.

Nothing serious. Just throw Franklin in front of it. Maybe we'll see that form between minor and major?<br>
</td></tr></table><br>
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Send Franklin in, as he is immune to the wiles of lightning.<br>

Temperature-wise, I was asking about the air, not about the trench-coat.

I dunno, not particularly hot or cold.<br><br>
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Hey! There's a blue crystal! I think you better get that right now.<br>
</td></tr></table><br>

With reckless abandon for your own well-being or others'!<br>
<br>
By which I mean freeze it so you can grab it safely. Or have Franklin do it instead.

<br><img src="Images\Alanna271.jpg"><br>
Still minor, just like last time he grabbed one of these.

Now put it in that puzzleshit on the right wall of this hallway.

Empty? Go in to check, it surely isn't a trap.

<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Make sure you take the blue crystal into the room with you if you're going to check it out - you wouldn't want somebody to be able to snatch it away and trap you!

Looks pretty empty to me.

<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Look under table.
</td></tr></table>
It's a solid stone slab sitting directly on the ground.<br>
<br>
<table bgcolor="FFFFFF"><tr><td>
With a blue crystal on hand you should be able to open the other door right near where you woke up. If the layout of this place makes any sense that should take you to the same area the fire-activated door would.
</td></tr></table>
Oh yeah! I totally forgot about that one. I'm glad you guys are here to help me with this stuff.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna275.jpg"><br>
Out this door to the main room...
<br><img src="Images\Alanna276.jpg"><br>
Through the top-symbol door...
<br><img src="Images\Alanna277.jpg"><br>
And here!
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
I forget if you've mentioned this before, Alanna, but are certain magics more susceptible to others? As a specific example, if Franklin went up against that frost sprite would one be at a large advantage?
</td></tr></table>
No, there's nothing like that.

Looks like an office? Hold on while we take a closer look...

Alright, wait for us to check out the room and we'll let you know if it's clear.

Watch out for the wall on your right. It looks like there's another opening there and we can't tell if it's safe yet.

Those... are Oak trees. I see a squirrel. I smell the breeze. I see the sun. This is home.

This is the book my mom used to read me. Or another copy of it, at least. The back is a cover like you would expect from a book.

Whatever you do, save that diary for last. In fact, hide it in your jacket immediately. The person who it belongs to always seems to show up the exact same moment you start discovering their darkest secrets by reading it.

<br>
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
I'd take it back to one of those dungeon rooms and lock yourself in if you're going to hunker down for some heavy reading. 'Cause like the others said, he's liable to show up while you're reading it.

<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Okay, Tristan is behind you, its a narrative convention, and way overused.
Grab the runic book and his diary while Franklin protects you from his attacks.
</td></tr></table>
<br>
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
I think you should prepare for some kind of magical duel. If Cheesegrateface McRedhead is paranoid, as most evil masterminds are, he has some kind of warning system on his personal quarters, or at least his diary. Grab anything that might teach you how to use your stinky spell components and scram.

Grab the diary, certainly, but don't read it until you're in a safer spot. As others have said, there's an unwritten law about these things.

Guys! Stop being ridiculous! My life is not some kind of narrative. Besides, I'd see him coming down the hall first anyway, assuming he doesn't have any way to teleport or something.<br>
<br>
You're making me nervous for no reason!<br>
<img src="Images\Alanna285.jpg"><br>
Hmm, most of it's written in some kind of code. It goes to normal english near the end though...<br>
<br>
<i>Just found this journal again. Code seems childish, now. Every year, I hate the person I was a year ago. Writing</i> deep dark secrets <i>about how magic is hard and girls don't like me and my teachers are simpletons and blah blah blah. The magnitude of my growth this year seems particularly astounding, and I find me of 16 especially loathsome.<br>
<br>
As if to provide a clear separation between these two beings, the infallible forces of magic have thrust a change upon me, from frost to lightning. A badge, a nametag, with a new name, and soon a new face.<br>
<br>
I have found the beings of legend unexpectedly pleasant. Planar construction, a monumental task for any mortal mage, has been remarkably easy for them, once shown the means. They have begun creating new life, a task once deemed only appropriate for their aggressor. EB's creations are simple, hairy savage things, as one might expect, but I suppose he is new at this. OB, on the other hand, has created amazing beings; part machine, part living tissue, powered by some manner of glowing ichor that courses through his domain.<br>
<br>
Both remain amenable to the prospect of union. They do not seem to understand human deception, and their fear of us seems to have evolved into some sort of grudging, misguided admiration over the eons in isolation.<br>
<br>
Their rites of summonation still remain elusive, but I feel a breakthrough is imminent on OB's part, at least.<br>
<br>
_______________________<br>
<br>
Successful summoning of OB. My heart leaps at the prospect of what must come next. I am confident in Z and his bretheren's abilities. I am ready. Like a child atop a particularly large slide, I must make a mantra of action, not thought. I stand at the precipice, all I've but to do is drop.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Z claims to have found a woman who unintentionally summoned EB in a state of mourning after her husband's passing. Some old adventuring sort, who lost relevance after the wilds were tamed, I am sure. The means are unclear, but she could simply be mindspliced to recover them.<br>
<br>
To top it off, she has a daughter, who coincidentally shares my birthday. The universe throws itself before the righteousness of my action, certainly.<br>
<br>
_______________________<br>
<br>
Amalgamation is successful. I have never felt more powerful. OB's protestations in the back of my mind are quibbling and confused. It understands so little. Tomorrow, the date of my birth, I will proceed to my new summoner, and my new host. Amalgamating the being to the human rather than the inverse should ensure the dominant personality is that of EB, assuming the necessary precautions are taken.<br>
<br>
_______________________<br>
<br>
Hello, Alanna. I have no doubt you will eventually recover this. I thought I should leave it for you, a birthday present. I don't know what perverse invocation you used to protect yourself, but I have clearly underestimated you. My heart raced when I heard you entering EB's domain. I surmised you were powerful due to your heritage, but untrained due to your mother's negligence. Clearly I was mistaken on the latter.<br>
<br>
I await you behind the large door bearing the symbol of the three. Undoubtedly you know how these things work by now.</i><br>

Whoa. That's creepy. And it seems the legend you told us earlier is true. I think that you should explore the entire complex before trying to open the door that that guy is behind.

<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
It said that Mom had channeled EB once, years ago. I think that Metalface believes that Alanna would be a good host for EB because of that.<br>
<br>
It explains not only our incredible frost-magic abilities (EB is the source of all frost magic, right?), but it explains both what those freaky yeti things in the dark hallway were (they are EB's creations, 'hairy savage things'), but why they protected us (they were created by EB, which is currently amalgamated to Alanna.<br>
<br>
Also Metalface is apparently amalgamated to OB, which explains his badass lightning powers. I don't know if we've met any of OB's creations yet, but they sound fearsome.
</td></tr></table><br>
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Oh... oh dear. Am I reading that right? Alanna has had the primal destroyer of all creation amalgamated to her?<br>
<br>
We still don't have the whole story, however. What does he hope to accomplish with all this? He seems to be manipulating the two godlike entities rather than vice-versa.
</td></tr></table>

I...I guess it explains...<br>
<br>
But why? How? I can't just... walk in there. That's what he wants. He's waiting for me. Can I even open that door, anyway?<br>
<br>
Mom summoned some kind of frost entity after dad died. I didn't know it was EB, though. Wow.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Whatever he's doing in there, it can't be good for me. For everybody. If... if I have EB in me, I have to do... something, right?
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Go into the door, but savestate beforehand, in case you die again.
</td></tr></table>
Which door? What's "savestate"?
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
I know you're going to insist on seeking this guy out, but at least peruse a few of the other books first; transport magic in particular may have some relevance.
</td></tr></table>
I don't know, should I seek him out? This is all so weird.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna288.jpg"><br>
Okay, this textbook is unintelligible to me. I've never studied magic before!
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Read the runic book.
</td></tr></table>
<br><img src="Images\Alanna289.jpg"><br>
NNG! It doesn't open.<br>
<br>
Mom has...<br>
<br>
...had a joke about adventuring mages collecting tomes of forbidden eldritch knowledge just to decorate their shelves, but I don't remember how it goes.

<tr><td bgcolor="#E2E2E2">
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
I agree with what the others are saying. Explore the rest of the compound before you confront MetalFace.<br>
<br>
And I would suggest starting with what's behind the Lightning Door.
</td></tr></table><br>
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Bump Franklin up with the crystal trick, then have them all go through the door of three ahead of you.
</td></tr></table>
Can I even open that door yet? Also, Franklin's upgrade from these things lasts like five seconds, tops. They are barely strong enough to do it.<br>
<br>
"C'mon, Franklin. There's probably nothing left in here for me."
