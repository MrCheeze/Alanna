Send Franklin out to investigate. Or us.

Look at the sky. Are the stars like you know them, or do they form unknown constellations? If they are different, you are probably kidnapped to another dimension and should try to banish yourself to return home.

Alanna, check if this is even your world first.<br>
This could be nasty if it wasn't.

You're right. Yesterday, I would have gone for it, no questions asked. With everything that's happened to me today, I think that would be a bad idea. Even though it feels... comforting? Familiar? Something.<p>
Can you guys check it out for me?

Uh... shit. Verdict, guys? I just heard a sound like stone scraping against stone coming from the yellow symbol hallway, and this door's closing.

It looks like hilly nature, can't see any amalgams or other nasties lurking about but it is dark! It's hard to tell how steep the hill is outside the door, I'm not sure if you could get down safely.<p>
I still vote you go outside though because I'm really worried about what might be coming through that yellow door.

The area directly ahead is flat. There are hills on all sides. Do you guys not have depth perception or something?<p>
I hear metallic footsteps!

None taken, that sounds about right.

Slip out quick. Lets hope you can always reopen the door from the outside the same way.

Yes, get outside. Metal footsteps sound like super bad news.

Don't worry, Alanna, the symbol is still here. I think.<p>
Go to the waterfall.

Whoever that was knows someone else is in here now. I gotta hide! I guess the water's a good place to do it...<p>
My PJs are gonna get wet, but I guess I don't have much choice.

The guy's here and he's got a sprite.

It is four-legged and droopy. Also, it has five eyes. Would it be possible to banish? Not saying that you should do that.

Four legs, five eyes? That sounds kinda like a frost sprite. But I'm not sure, how do you know it was a sprite and not just some random spectre like the hand things?<p>
Then again, frost sprite makes sense. He's a lightning mage and he had to get through that door somehow.<p>
...

Uh...

Guys, I'm not breathing. Like, I don't feel the need to take a breath.<p>

I'm just getting hungrier.

Hha hah good one.<p>
But no seriously shut up I am starving and I'm getting hungrier the longer I stop breathing.
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Is it possible frost mages in general don't need to breathe in water? Ice is simply water, and thus might offer some affinity.
</td></tr></table>
No, I've never heard of that, and there aren't any physiological changes associated with the other elements that I know of.

Swim to the waterfall. Do not come up for air. It is irrelavant. On a plus note, you are not trapped in your mind. 
</td></tr></table>
That's always a plus.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna186.jpg"><br>
Now what?<p>
In case you didn't see down under the water, this lake is basically a giant tunnel going down, with glowing things along the walls. I can't tell what they are.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna187.jpg"><br>
It looks like it curves off towards the waterfall down there.

Is there anything behind the fall? Usually, in places like these, you'll findy a watery cave.
</td></tr></table>
<br><img src="Images\Alanna188.jpg"><br>
Nope. It's just a steep wall covered with some kind of slippery stuff. There's some kind of hole up there that the water's coming out of, and there's some kind of tunnel below.<p>
Out or down? I don't know what to do, and you guys haven't seemed to come to a consensus.

If you don't need to breathe underwater, feeling hungry instead of suffocated, could you try taking gulps of water to stave it off? Probably wouldn't help much...<p>

On your way into the tunnel, touch one of the lights.

It's cold, and embedded in the wall. I am glad they are here, because I wouldn't be able to tell where the walls were otherwise, it's dark down here.<p>
The hunger's getting worse. I'm going to go down.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna192.jpg"><br>
Here's the tunnel. There's some suction going through it.<p>
I am feeling lightheaded.

It Ts off here, up and down. Water's going down. I'm really not feeling good. Pick a direction.

Yeah. Me too. Leaving, finally.
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Yep, you're in a field floating throught space. That entire waterfall is pouring out of a tiny cloud and those blue things are still floating around the void in a curved path.<p>
There's a tree off to your left. It's uh, blue but it might have some edible fruit on it? Anything to stop you being quite so gigantically black and spiky.

Yeah, black plasticky stuff on my arms and legs. Feels cool. Where did it come from?

I have an omnious feeling about that black stuff, like what was on your mother.

Is it black black, or is it extra-dimensional-entity-light-absorption black? Because it seems to start to appear any time you get injured, and I think your lack of air counts as injury for the purposes of this...

Light absorption black.

You. It appeared when you shattered Mr Handy too. Relax, eat something, maybe it'll go away.

I didn't notice.

Wait, doesn't it dissapear when you absorb blood? And appear when you hurt yourself...What if you're completely covered!

Hah. Who knows.<p>
Hang on a second, guys.

There's fruit on that tree down there. It's a very comforting tree. I don't know why I know that.

Head for the tree. Food is good.

Rather go this way than through the water.<p>
Don't think I can get back up like that though.

I'm still hungry, but I feel a little better. A little calmer. This is nice.

Grab the fruit.

Examine the crazily coloured fruit. Also, what's the tree feel like up close? Awake? Or just comforting?

I don't know! I feel kind of weird talking about it. It's very familiar-feeling. Even though it's unlike any tree I've ever seen; the bark is silvery-gray and the leaves are blue. There are a bunch of these fruits on it.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna206.jpg"><br>
It's got a thin, very colorful skin, like a nectarine or something. I peeled off a little piece of it, just to see the inside. It's juicy, orange, and soft.<p>
I'm starving, and it's the only thing to eat I've seen around.

So eat it. What's the worst it could do?

I'll go gather some more. I'm still hungry too.

I'm sorry, I didn't even consider that you guys would need food. How do I...?

Also, while it's still here, see if that black stuff does anything to augment your magic. It seemed to, against the hand-demon-whatever-it-was.
