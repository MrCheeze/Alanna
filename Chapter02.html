Yeah! It's totally my eighteenth birthday! I'm Alanna, by the way. I was gonna move out tomorrow, but my mom had<br>
to...<br>
go...<br>
on...<br>

Why would I do that? Everything is great here. Very safe, and NOTHING bad ever happens!<p>

What, this? Oh, it's an old book of myths translated from the Old Tongue. My mom used to read it to me when I was little. I decided to re-read it last night for nostalgia's sake, but I think I only got about halfway through.

Let's see...battle... fragmented...void... here we go.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna70.jpg"><br>
The three resolved to split the weave in two, one half for AB and the other half for OB and EB.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna71.jpg"><br>
AB took its half and nurtured it, crafting a new world of life and innumerable subtleties.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna72.jpg"><br>
OB began to take its half apart, piece by piece, and learn everything there was to know about it. When it learned everything it could about one fragment, it fed it to EB and plucked off another.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna73.jpg"><br>
Being infinite beings, they did not understand the nature of finite things, and after eons passed they were surprised to find EB had consumed the last piece.<p>
They grew furious and jealous, and both approached AB demanding more.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna74.jpg"><br>
But AB's creations had been long in the making, and long had they been able to tap into the magic left behind by the battle of the three eons ago. They drove OB and EB away before AB even had time to respond.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna75.jpg"><br>
They retreated into the blackness of the void to languish and hunger forever.

Where you splice the thoughts and intentions of one being over the body, memories, and abilities of another. Extremely frowned upon.
