<tr><td bgcolor="#E2E2E2">
<br><img src="Images\Alanna426.jpg"><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">I have been betrayed. I never knew such deceit was possible. You have endured more than I would have thought it possible to endure. I know it is terrible to have this burden on you. But, It has been thrust upon your back and you must carry on, or be crushed by it. Those are your only options, wish though we both may that it were not the case. You must confront Tristan.<br>
<br>
I will help you using any of the means available to me. First, I will give you my wisdom, my analysis. Help you understand what has been done to you.<br>
<br>
Usually when two beings are amalgamated, expressions of the presence of one take shape using the form of the other. That is, the expected result if EB's presence were making itself visible on your body would be changes in your flesh and bone, not an other-planar black mass. This, combined with the fact that I was unable to peer into your mind any further back than the point you were joined with these spectral advisors, leads me to one conclusion: any intrusion into your mind is taken on by the spectral advisors, rather than you. They are the ones who are amalgamated to EB, and the black form is their spectral body being warped into a new shape. They are likely unaware of it, as the nature of the spell keeps them separate from the presence they inhabit in our plane, which should be the shape of your body. But, as they are bound to your mind, you can control EB's gifts as long as they are with you.<br>
<br>
I have other gifts for you. As offended as I am that my blood children are being used as mere door locks, I have seen the mechanism opening the door Tristan is behind. For that, you will need these.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna427.jpg"><br>
It is no longer my place to alter the laws of magic for any being but myself, and you who have invited me to do so. I grant you the ability to communicate with any of the three elemental beings while you are in our presence, regardless of any amalgamation or any other effect. I also will give you understanding of the means of harnessing a type of magical energy thus far unfamiliar to you, but very important to me. You know when you will need it.

<font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #0000FF">I am sorry.<br></span></font>
<img src="Images\Alanna430.jpg"><br>
Franklin, you have been a good friend to Alanna all this time, yet your presence is easily disposed of by anyone knowing a simple banishment spell. I give you a ward against banishment.<br>
<br>
And you, spectral advisors. Though this is your purpose, I give you advice.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna418.jpg"><br>
Know when to let go.</span></font>

Alanna... maybe you should ask if there's anything more you... or we, can do here for them.<br>

Is there anything, OB?

We had no idea... Thank the OB ..and I guess we should move on,

<br>
I do not know what Tristan is doing behind the door, but it seems likely he has prepared for your arrival in some way, and may be fortifying those preparations as we speak. However, if you need more time to prepare yourself, mentally or some other way, it is understandable.</span></font>

Or hmm, how about asking him if there is a way to minimise the side-effects of that black stuff? I have a bad feeling about the upcoming battle, they usually start getting too strong for our own or in this case, her good and in the end, I fear that she would have to push her soul over the limit during the confrontation or that she would have to use that black stuff for too long...

Hello there, EB. It's good to formally make the acquaintance of Alanna's final hitchhiker.

I don't suppose you could somehow improve Alanna's combat casting abilities, OB? Or tell us how to more effectively cooperate with EB?

<br>
Alanna, I have been forced to use your body's energy or mine to heal you and keep you alive and alert. I...cannot apologize enough for the way I made you get that energy earlier.<br>
<br>
My body is very tired now. I have been using all of my energy for you. You have been awake and active for nearly two days straight. I am very, very hungry. I will, of course, continue to sacrifice on your behalf if that is your will. You have shown me AB's gift of giving, and I am grateful to make use of it. But, I may be better able to help you if you could get some rest and some food before then. If I cannot sustain that sacrifice any longer, my hunger will become yours, as you have experienced in the past.</span></font>

Now that EB and OB are here to talk with us, maybe they could tell their side of the "creation myth" that was in that book?
</td></tr></table>
<font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #0000FF">The "myth" as you read it is more or less correct.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna432.jpg"><br>
At our conception, each of us has simple minds, and we understood but one thing.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna433.jpg"><br>
Almost as if we came into being to battle.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna434.jpg"><br>
AB best understood the drive to create, to give.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna435.jpg"><br>
OB best understood the drive to understand, to learn.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna436.jpg"><br>
And I best understood the drive to take, to devour.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna437.jpg"><br>
I have come to understand that, of the three imperatives, your kind puts the most merit on the giving, the creation, and scorns the domain of my brother and I.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna438.jpg"><br>
Perhaps there is something to that. Perhaps the domain of AB is "better".
<br><img src="Images\Alanna439.jpg"><br>
But perhaps you only feel that way because you are his children.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna440.jpg"><br>
Perhaps there is merit in dissection and destruction.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna441.jpg"><br>
Regardless, it was all we understood. <I>We did not know anything else.</I>
<br><img src="Images\Alanna442.jpg"><br>
You mustn't glorify AB and demonize OB and I simply because we came into being understanding different things.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna443.jpg"><br>
When Tristan came to me, he taught me more about the drives and desires of AB than AB ever did.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna444.jpg"><br>
Odd, that his children are better able to communicate his will than he was.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna445.jpg"><br>
I took to it well, and began to use the fragments of AB's essence to create my own world, as AB had.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna446.jpg"><br>
Of course, it may seem crude by your standards.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna447.jpg"><br>
It is thus far incomplete.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna448.jpg"><br>
I think it beautiful nonetheless.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna449.jpg"><br>
I have had but a few days to build, as opposed to the countless eons AB has been at work.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna450.jpg"><br>
To continue, though Tristan taught me much about the act of creation, he did not tell me his intentions.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna451.jpg"><br>
In fact, I don't think I even comprehended that he could have them.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna452.jpg"><br>
I doubt OB understands this yet, either.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna453.jpg"><br>
I have learned much from my experiences here,
<br><img src="Images\Alanna454.jpg"><br>
with you.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna455.jpg"><br>
All of you.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna456.jpg"><br>
We are not so simple, we just have yet to be taught.</span></font>
