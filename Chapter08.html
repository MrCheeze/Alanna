I don't know about you guys, but when we open that final door to confront Tristan I want whole armies of these mechanical guys going in first (and then I want the great hairy things behind them).

First of all, DON'T take the blue crystals. It's karma or something... Maybe...<br>
Pick a hall at random.

It seems more of you guys want me to help them out than take the crystal and abandon them. Though I'm not too big on the idea of actually confronting Tristan, they don't seem to be too happy with him. At the very least I might get some protection while I try to find a way out.<br>

OH!

I'm gonna go this way, because a little hopping thing just hopped through. It's got some glowing red stuff on its back.

The red thing on its back looked bigger than the crystal, but it was about the same shade of red, and they both glow. I can't compare more closely than that, because it just did that thing with the lights. There's a room here, and the floor is transparent.

It looks complicated down there.

It's just six tubes, going up into the ceiling. That appears to be an arrow etched into the metal, mot any sort of indentation. Either that's an insignia of some sort or an indication that this thing takes something up.

<font color="#FF0000">The walls except the one you came in are bare. The floor and ceiling are equilateral triangles, with the ceiling being smaller than the floor. The wall you came in is perpendicular to the floor while the other two are slanted, as though you are up against one of the edges of the pyramid. There are three doors on this wall. The one in the middle goes back perpendicular to the wall, and is the one you came in. The ones on either side appear to be parallel to the walls closest to them, so 60 degrees divergent from the hall you just went down.</font>

Hmm, about halfway through the hallway, there are two lights on the floor and none where you'd expect them to be on the ceiling. Also, there's this groove running all the way around the hall.

This room looks about the same as the other one.<br>

Okay, the middle hallway in this room went back to the room I started in. So if I go down the one to my left, it should take me to the same place I would get if I had gone through either of the other halls in the other rooms, right?

<tr><td bgcolor="#E2E2E2">

First, walk around the entire pyramid, to make sure it's as thought. Then, walk through all unexplored hallways to be sure. Then, think about the differences in the three main halls and solve weird puzzle shit.

<br><img src="Images\Alanna361.jpg"><br>
Okay. I'll start with this hallway coming off the main room I haven't been in yet.<br>
Hey, check it out. This must be where the blue crystals are, but it looks like someone put the panel back on the wall. I can still see it by the blue glowing stuff from the broken crystal, though.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna362.jpg"><br>
Weird, there's no room at the end of this hall, it just Ts off. The left side curves off a little ways down. The right side is a downward ramp that also curves off at the bottom.
</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="#E2E2E2">
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
I say go to your left and map out that path for completeness and safety.<br>
<br>
If I'm interpreting this correctly the right hallway off the bottom triangular room (the one with the 'up' machine) should have a dead end rather than joining this junction you are standing at now.<br>
<br>
I am curious about what is down those paths and I imagine it would be a good idea to know all alternate routes between the rooms if something went wrong.
</td></tr></table>
Sure.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna363.jpg"><br>
Around the corner, there's another one of these things where there's a groove going around the hallway, and a light on the floor on both sides.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna364.jpg"><br>
Okay, this leads to the room with the smoke below the floor.<br>
I'll go check that other hallway coming off the other one of these rooms.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna365.jpg"><br>
You're right, it's a dead end. There's a light on the floor in front of it.
<br><img src="Images\non-comics\AlannaMiniMap3.jpg"><br>

so head down the ramp!

yes, we should finish exploring

<br><img src="Images\Alanna366.jpg"><br>
Okay, down the ramp. It turns at the bottom into a straight hallway.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna367.jpg"><br>
With another of these things.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna368.jpg"><br>
There's a room at the end of the hall. It has a transparent ceiling.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna369.jpg"><br>
That thing looks complicated. Hopefully that's not what I'm here to fix.<br>
<br>
It seems to be working fine, doing... whatever it's doing.

<tr><td bgcolor="#E2E2E2">
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
I think that's a crystal-making machine! If you can figure out how to work it, all crystal-shortage problems will be a thing of the past. Let's take a closer look at it.<br>
<br>
Also, are there more hallways leading out of this room?
</td></tr></table>
I dunno, where would it make crystals from?
<br><img src="Images\Alanna370.jpg"><br>
The two sides of it look exactly the same, except inverted. There's all these cylinders with knobs or dials or something on top. They all have either a hole or a pipe connecting them to another cylinder on the front, back, and each side. The pipes probably connect with the holes. Connecting to the three cylinders on the back row are three tubes with a section of the top exposed. There's a differently-colored glowing liquid in each one.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna371.jpg"><br>
They all feed into these tubes, which go up. If I'm figuring this right, that's the room with the machine with the up arrow-like thing on it above us.<br>
<br>
I kinda don't want to mess with this machinery, it looks important. If it's a crystal-making machine, maybe I could ask one of these robot guys how it works...?
<br><img src="Images\Alanna372.jpg"><br>
This is the only door in or out on this floor.

...well, it'd be a pretty awesome way to die.
</td></tr></table>
You guys got me thinking about this. These tubes look like some kind of metallic mesh, with enough slack to hold onto a couple at once. Maybe Franklin and I could hold onto them and flip the pyramid, and then climb down. I'm in pretty good shape and I'm fairly flexible, I think I could do it.
</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="#E2E2E2">
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Do it then, and zap the pymaswitch<br>
<br>
I think pymaswitch is a good name for the thing, right?
</td></tr></table><br>
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
Sure, go for it. Also, have Franklin ready to zap it again if anything goes wrong.
</td></tr></table><br>
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
To avoid embarrassing situations involving your fashion choices, as well as not having to force to author to do a tasteful modification of gravity in the interest of not scaring the viewers out of their minds if it all goes wrong (clothingwise, or otherwise), I think that flipping the pyramid in the middle is a bad idea.
</td></tr></table><br>
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>
As she's well aware of, her clothing is VERY starched. Cheesegraterface McRedhead likes to have his minions look sharp, so no clothing mishaps here. Flip away!
</td></tr></table>
What? How are you feeling my clothes? That's kind of creepy, guys. It's not starched, but I think my coat's pretty much pinned to this tube by my legs. I'm trusting you to look away if it goes awry.<br>
"Franklin, zap it!"
<br><img src="Images\Alanna373.jpg"><br>
There's a pause here, probably while the lower pyramid goes down...
<br><img src="Images\Alanna374.jpg"><br>
Here we go!
<br><img src="Images\Alanna375.jpg"><br>
Wait, did it do it? I'm still rightside-up. I'm gonna go check the hallway.
<br><img src="Images\Alanna376.jpg"><br>
Okay, two things. First, the hall I came in dead-ends now. Second, when I get close to the light on the floor, There's some kind of rippling energy field, and everything on the other side of it falls up. Franklin is about half-in, and he's floating...
<br><img src="Images\Alanna377.jpg"><br>
Weird.<br>
<br>
Maybe there's some artificial gravity inside the pyramid?
